                You are about to enter the “question” section” of our book.
                
                Note:  You will need a yellow highlighter from this point on.
                
                This section will help you organize your thoughts, choose your questions, and help you gather the information that you need in making an intelligent decision.  As always, the ultimate goal is to give you peace of mind.
                
                These questions were created with the intention of educating you and giving you a tool that will put YOU in control of the touring experience.  All of the questions are grouped by subjects for your convenience.  This will help you while YOU are interviewing the Assisted Living Facility.
                
                From this point on, we will call the potential resident, a resident, ok?
                
                After you have read all of the questions, go over all of the questions once again and highlight the ones that you think are appropriate for your search.
                
                It’s ok if you highlighted just a few questions or if you want to ask all of the questions in the book. These highlighted questions that you have selected are now tailored to your needs or to the needs of your loved one. These will be the questions that you will ask throughout your ALF tour.  The KEY is to gather the correct answers that you need.
                
                Remember, you know yourself or your loved one better than anybody else…….but take into consideration the current status of that person at the time of your search.

                Let’s think about what a “first impression” really means in our particular case.  You are looking for a place that will take wonderful care of your loved one.  If the facade of the structure is in disrepair, the landscaping leaves a lot to be desired, and no thought is given to its upkeep, then, what does this say about how they will take care of your mother, father, aunt or uncle?
                
                The care of the outside of the facility is indicative of the care one would receive inside the facility.
