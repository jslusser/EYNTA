                You are about to enter the “question” section of our book.
                
                This section will help you organize your thoughts, choose your questions, and help you gather the information that you need in making an intelligent decision.  As always, the ultimate goal is to give you peace of mind.
                
                These questions were created with the intention of educating you and giving you a tool that will put YOU in control of the touring experience.  All of the questions are grouped by subjects for your convenience.  This will help you while YOU are interviewing the Assisted Living Facility.
                
                From this point on, we will call the potential resident, a resident, ok?
                
                After you have read all of the questions, go over all of the questions once again and select the ones that you think are appropriate for your search using the toggle switch to the right of the question.  Once the question is selected, the toggle switch will turn yellow and you will be able to enter the answer in the space provided.
                
                It’s ok if you selected just a few questions or if you want to ask all of the questions in the book. These questions that you have selected are now tailored to your needs or to the needs of your loved one. These will be the questions that you will ask throughout your ALF tour.  The KEY is to gather the correct answers that you need.
                
                Remember, you know yourself or your loved one better than anybody else...but take into consideration the current status of that person at the time of your search.

If the facade of the structure is in disrepair, the landscaping leaves a lot to be desired, and no thought is given to its upkeep, then, what does this say about how they will take care of your mother, father, aunt or uncle?
                
                The care of the outside of the facility is indicative of the care one would receive inside the facility.

                 When it comes to Assisted Living placement, gay seniors face more issues than seniors from the heterosexual community. First and foremost, members of the LGBTQ community are less likely to have adult children to care for them.

                 Many LGBTQ community members have been forgotten or deserted by their own family members. This means there will be no relative or family member willing to oversee their care in their time of need.

                 It is important to realize, that in the gay community, senior-related issues are still relatively new, as gay rights efforts have traditionally been youth focused.

                 It should not matter if you are gay or straight, all individuals should have the same right to live in a place where people feel welcome and happy, respecting each other as part of a society.

                 As we mentioned in other chapters, the selection of a facility should not be based on how fancy it is or how the person looks who is giving you a tour. It is about the WHOLE package, i.e.; employees, surroundings, clinical, services, activities, and in this case, the population and the supportive services available to the LGBTQ community.

                 It is important to understand that, along with having lovely accommodations and great amenities, recreational activities are important as well. Recreational activities can vary from arts and crafts classes, to outings such as shows, movies, theater, dinner, shopping etc… and why not be able to go to a bar within reasonable hours… maybe for Happy Hour at 5 or 6 pm?

                 For example, here is a question you may want to keep in mind. If you or your loved one is accustomed to having a drink every day at 6 pm, can you still have it in the new community you have chosen?

                 The intention of this chapter is for you to be able to think about what is relevant to you and your loved one. It is not to create arguments or cause problems. You or your Caregiver must keep in mind that the selection of Alternative Housing, (Independent Living, Assisted Living, etc.) must meet some basic clinical, geographical, financial and psychosocial needs.

                 In this chapter, we are giving you and/or your Caregiver basic information to help you in the process of selecting Alternative Housing, taking into consideration your specific likes and dislikes.

                 Remember, in any community or society, there is always some form of discrimination among themselves. Society tends to label people and their behaviors rather than embrace and try to understand the differences.

                 Finding out if a corporation offers same sex or partnership benefits to their employees is a good indication of what that corporation is about and if they are sensitive to diverse needs.

                 You may find out that the person who is conducting the interview at the facility may be gay or gay friendly, but that does not mean that the facility or the corporation is.

                 It is important to find out if the community you are interested in is involved with any gay organizations and how in tune they are to LGBTQ needs. If not, which may be the most common case, ask if they know of any gay organizations close to the facility so that you may be able to take advantage of their activities.

                 Regarding accommodations, it is important that you know it is very normal for 2 men or 2 women to be accommodated in the same room as roommates. Many older adults cannot afford to have a private room and opt for sharing with another person. In fact, sharing a room is more the norm that having a private accommodation.

                 Assisted Living Communities offer special spousal fees, rates and services. We have set up a question format so that you will be able to take advantage of these benefits if it applies in your state, based on your legal status. Some of the benefits are second person fees, couple fees, security deposits, etc.

                 As we mentioned in previous chapters, there is a second person special rate. It is important to understand how this second person rate can work for you, if it is applicable.

                 Depending on what state you are in, and their laws, you may or may not be able to take advantage of this specific rate for couples. The second person rate usually applies to a legally married spouse.

                 It is also the norm to leave the community for a specific event. Many residents go to family functions, travel to visit relatives or just go out to dinner with a friend. While this is normal, it is important to respect the rules in your new community.

                 Remember that these communities are regulated by a governmental agency and the community itself must follow rules and regulations. Most have a sign out sheet. This record is important for your safety. Imagine if there were a fire and they could not find you? Or if your family called and the facility had no idea where you were? You can see that this could cause serious issues.

                 When you have a question concerning the rules and regulations, please ask the Administrator and you will most likely find out that the answer has something to do with state regulations.

                 Along with state regulations, there are or could be policies and procedures that are specific to each individual corporation. These policies and procedures are legal and they must be followed. Corporations can have their own policies and procedures as long as they do not interfere with the state regulations for Alternative Housing.

                 It is important to be realistic with the situation that you are facing while searching for that special place. Things may not be as perfect as we may want them to be, so it is important to be creative and make it as perfect as possible for you.

                 One of the amenities that may be very important is the transportation service. This feature of a community may be relevant for some individuals. If you are the type of person who likes to go out or see friends on a regular basis, you may want to make sure that the community offers transportation. You may want to ask if it is a bus or a private car, if that is relevant to you.

                 While you are receiving a tour of the community, make sure that you ask the person that is touring you if they feel that a gay resident would be comfortable in their facility.

                 As people who have worked in the industry for many years, we understand the industry very well and no matter if it is in Florida or California, remember, Healthcare is a business. Independent Living, Assisted Living, Nursing Homes, etc…. are all a part of Healthcare. So, make sure that you ask questions from previous chapters and include the ones that are pertinent to your search.

                 It is important to take into consideration your personal needs, your likes and dislikes, and your choice of lifestyle while selecting the correct assisted living facility for you.

                 The following questions are specific and pertinent to the LGBTQ community.

                    Cindy VanDusen began her senior advocate career as a Certified Exercise Instructor in 1983 and brought that knowledge to the senior population by creating exercise and fitness programs for many Assisted Living Facilities and Nursing Homes.  For 11 years, she owned and operated her own exercise studio, “Off Broadway Workshop,” where she offered special classes for seniors.
                
                    In 1992, she created her own company, “Activities on Wheels” which brought activity programs into various health care facilities and senior living condominiums.  “Activities on Wheels” provided her with  experience in dealing with diverse types of health care facilities as well as a diverse senior population. She worked with Independent, Assisted Living, Dementia and Nursing Home residents, realizing that each segment of the senior population had very different needs.
                     Cindy VanDusen has written and published many  books and games for the senior population including “Make Your Point,” (1996) “Math and Riddle Bingo,” (1998), “Quizmania,” (2001) and “You Can’t Bloom In Your Room,” (2003), all of which are still available today.
                     After selling her successful company, she became interested in the Administration area of the health care industry.  She earned her CORE Training Certificate from the Florida Department of Elder Affairs in 2000 and became involved in Marketing and Sales for Assisted Living Facilities. After 12 years in the same 200 bed Assisted Living Facility as the Marketing and Sales Director, she stepped into the Executive Director position.
                     Ms. VanDusen has published many articles on senior activities in magazines and newspapers throughout her career.
                     In 2007, Ms. VanDusen became the Administrator of Placement Counselors Corporation.
                     Together, Cindy and Humberto have over 42 years of experience in the health care field.   The successful blending of their diverse and interesting backgrounds has resulted in this first book in a series on various aspects of health care.  They hope to educate and enlighten the public by providing good, solid advice based on their experiences.
                     At Placement Counselors Corporation we strive to stimulate our seniors with quality products.  We truly believe that they should be offered products that are challenging, interesting, and stimulating.
                
                Through our formal education and experience in the field, and as owners of senior related businesses, we are able to comprehend and understand the health care needs of clients, families and health care providers, thus creating our perfect partnership.
                     All the items that we present at Placement Counselors Corporation are of our own creation.  As a unique team, we are able to create books, games, music and other related products that can be used by professionals and caregivers working with the geriatric population.
                     We hope you will continue to visit our site regularly as we will be adding new and interesting products all the time.
