In the past two decades, Assisted Living Facilities have grown nationwide in the health care industry.

There are approximately 40,000 Assisted Living Facilities operating in the United States today.  The number of residents living in a facility can range from just a few to over 300, with the most common size housing between 25 and 120 individuals.

Years ago, everyone referred to all nursing facilities as “the home.”  The population within them was a mix and match of all ages, diagnoses, and behaviors.  When a family could no longer care for a loved one, they had no choice but to place him or her in “the home.”  It was the only option available to them at the time.

When Assisted Living Facilities were first created, they were more like hotels or retirement communities.  If people had incontinence issues or required more one on one supervised, personal care, they would have to leave the facility and go to a nursing home.

During this time there was a tremendous growth in the senior population.  This was due to many factors such as seniors living longer, and the knowledge that the baby boomers would be aging in the very near future.  The governmental agencies, nationwide, had to modify, update, and find new ways to accommodate the senior community.

The government and the health care industry worked together to create regulated communities to provide appropriate, as well as personalized care that would meet the needs of each individual.  These changes not only improved the quality of service, but made it more cost-effective for families paying privately.  It was also more cost-effective for the government to assist an individual financially and make sure they were receiving the proper care in an Assisted Living Facility rather than a Skilled Nursing Home.

Once the Assisted Living Facilities were established, the need for other types of alternative housing came to light.  Some of these were Independent Living Facilities, Adult Family Care Homes, Alzheimer-Dementia Units and Skilled Nursing Facilities.

Even today, many people do not completely understand the concept of, or what is actually offered in an Assisted Living Facility.

Assisted Living Facilities are licensed and regulated by the state in which they are located.  Because the concept of an Assisted Living Facility can vary from state to state, eligibility can also vary.

In some cases, the criterion for being admitted into an Assisted Living Facility, is as simple as being able to transfer from one chair to another with assistance.  Keep in mind, the resident must be able to assist in completing this task.  The purpose of an Assisted Living Facility is to “ASSIST,” not to actually do the task for the resident.  The goal is to keep the resident as active and involved in his own personal care while performing the Activities of Daily Living.

Admission criteria are not only based on clinical aspects, but on many other issues such as safety.  A prospective resident must be physically able to exit the building, with assistance, in a fire drill or any other emergency situation.

In some cases, Assisted Living Facilities will not admit people even if they can transfer.   Each facility has its own criteria, their own policies, and their own target population type.  They may not want wheelchairs or even walkers. This is up to them.  They can implement any house policy they choose, as long as they remain in compliance with the state regulations.

Because Assisted Living Facilities are privately or corporately owned, the policies they implement are legal as long as they are approved by the health care administration in whatever state they are located.

Assisted Living Facility is the most common term used for this type of housing.  Some other terms are:

     • Residential Care Facilities
     • Personal Care Facilities
     • Adult Congregate Care Communities
     • Retirement Residences
     • Supported Care Facilities
     • Senior Living Communities
 
In Florida, and in many other states, six-bed facilities are becoming very popular, as well.  These smaller facilities are gaining popularity due to the fact that they are able to provide more personalized services.  These facilities are usually in private homes and are licensed and regulated by the same governmental agencies that govern all of the Assisted Living Facilities, regardless of size.  The smaller homes must pass all surveys and inspections required by the state in which they are located.
 The average age of a resident in an Assisted Living Facility is a little over 80, and usually someone who is in need of at least one or more Activities of Daily Living.  Some of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) are showering, dressing, toileting, eating and medication management.  The staff of an Assisted Living Facility is trained to provide assistance with all of those ADLs.

We should mention here that the need for some type of lifestyle change is usually first indicated when a person has difficulty in one or more of the following areas:

     • Difficulty in self-care, such as bathing, dressing, toileting, or eating;
     • Decline in physical or mental health;
     • Family not available to provide care or supervision.
 
As we mentioned before, as a result of new regulations and changes in the health care industry, residents are now provided with more services in an Assisted Living Facility to include, but are not limited to:  housekeeping and laundry services, transportation to doctors, social activities and 24 hour supervision.

There are many Assisted Living Facilities that provide care for the mentally ill and people with advanced dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Secured areas for individuals that require closer supervision in order to manage their behaviors are provided.  These areas can be a part of the main building or a separate, self-contained unit.

Assisted Living Facilities offer social and recreational programs, entertainment, and other stimulating activities.  Studies show that social interaction and activities have a strong impact on the well- being of the elderly.  The goal of the Assisted Living Facility is to promote the independence of the residents as well as provide a home-like setting.  Having an active and social environment can help to achieve this goal.

Most facilities are paid for by private, “out of pocket” funds.  However, financial assistance can be found through the Veteran’s Administration, Long Term Care Insurance, and some state programs if certain requirements are met.

The majority of facilities receive payments on a monthly basis, similar to a rent. Many require a security deposit or a community fee which may be refundable, depending on the community policy.

It is important to note that additional fees may be included in the monthly rate.  There may be fees for “a la carte” services or Level of Care.  Some communities do have an all-inclusive rate which may be more beneficial for the prospective resident.  This will allow for more care as needed while maintaining the same monthly rate.

Every state requires a contract.  In this contract, you will find the monthly costs and a list of services that the individual will be receiving at the facility. Contracts may be broken by giving a written notice in the time frame required by the state in which the facility is located and by the community policy.

Overall, the best way to describe Assisted Living is to think of it as a bridge between living at home and living in a nursing home.  Assisted Living has a residential focus with a home-like environment.  A nursing home is primarily a medical institution.

Assisted Living is an exciting option for individuals who want to maximize their independence while living in the safety of a supervised, residential setting.  Next up: Chapter 2 - In Other Words

Now that you have read all of the technical stuff, let’s sit down and chat.
        
As professionals, we take our job very seriously.  Our job is to assist seniors and families and healthcare professionals in choosing an Assisted Living Community for their loved one or client. We understand that this is a very important decision and we do not take it lightly.

On the other hand, we believe that humor can help in every situation.  Throughout this book, you will see that we will always give you the technical information that you need with a touch of humor thrown in. This is a trying time for you and our goal is to help you get through it.

Let's figure out what’s important in selecting an Assisted Living Facility. Many of you are looking for a community that is beautiful and fancy.  While you want it to be nice, you have to realize the true needs of the person who will be living there. You know your loved one better than anyone else. Would a chandelier and marble floor be important to them? If it is, then you may have to take that into consideration. Otherwise, those items could make your loved one feel uncomfortable if he or she is not used to it.

Also, while looking for communities to visit, remember that the largest and most expensive advertisement doesn’t always represent the most loving and caring place.  When looking for communities, you can ask friends, go on the internet, talk to your clergy, look in the phone book, call a placement agency, or a social service agency.

Make sure you look at communities that match the geographical needs of you and your loved one.  You want it to be close to family and possibly, their doctor.

It’s important to make a plan.  After you choose the communities that you’re going to go and see, set up a tour.  Dedicate a day to do this.  Allow at least an hour for each community.  You may want to see one in the morning, have lunch and see two in the afternoon.  However you want to do it, just make sure that you allow enough time to tour each community and time to get from one to the other.  If it takes more than one day, that is fine also.  The key is to stay calm and gather all of the information you are going to need to make a decision that both you and your loved one will be comfortable with.

Many people like to just “show up” at a community without an appointment.  These people are called “show-uppers.”  There are many reasons why this is not a good idea. The most important one is time.  If you show up for a tour without an appointment, there may be another family touring and you may have to wait a long time until they can get to you.  Good communities take time with each family. You would want this same treatment for you and your family as well.  So, don’t be a “SHOW-UPPER!”

Having been Administrators of very large communities, we have witnessed, first hand, what can happen when people just  “show up.” You may come upon a scenario that is unpleasant or unnerving.  Things happen in communities with an elderly population, and the community should not be judged by an isolated incident, but by how it is handled by the staff.

Another important reason you should make an appointment is the fact that you want to tour the community with the Sales or Marketing Representative, not a receptionist or office worker as a fill in. While they may be able to show you around, they are not going to be able to answer all of your questions and give you the personal attention that you will require in making this important decision. In other words, you may end up getting a tour from the janitor on his way to Mrs. Jones in room 209.

Remember, all of these communities are regulated by state laws, but don’t expect perfection at all times.  These same communities are run by human beings, and we know human beings are not perfect.

Once you are in the community and touring, look around and try to think…would your loved one like it?  Is it a place where they would be comfortable?  Is it what they are used to?  Look at the activities that are offered.  Will they be of interest to them?  When you look at the rooms, try to think of what they will require.  Maybe, it’s just a television, an easy chair, a bed, a dresser, a refrigerator, a closet and a bathroom.  The important thing is that you must try to judge everything based on what THEY will require, not what YOU require.  In other words, who is really moving in?  Next up: Chapter 3 - Before You Go

"""
    
    static let chapter3Text: String = """
Now that you have chosen the facilities you want to tour, it’s time to make an appointment. Ask to speak with the Marketing or Sales Director.  Tell them that you would like to ask a few questions before you decide to tour.

What is the Marketing Director’s name?  Will that person be the one to tour you?  Can he or she tour you on a weekend?  If not, is there an Assistant Marketing Director?  What is his or her name?  Will he or she be able to tour you on a weekend?

Ask some brief, general questions about cost and accommodations.   Discuss price ranges for the type of room you think that you may be interested in.  Make sure the Facility is within your budget range before you go.  Of course, if you have time, you can ask the Marketing Director to send you brochures with a price list and you can digest that information before you go to tour the facility.

When speaking with the Marketing Director, give a brief synopsis of your loved one’s condition.  In most cases, the Marketing Director will be able to tell you on the phone whether they can accommodate him or her at their facility. Depending on what care your loved one needs, ask questions pertaining to his or her specific situation, such as Alzheimer care, acceptance of wheelchairs (electric or otherwise), catheters, and/or feeding tubes.  These types of preliminary questions will assist you in not wasting your valuable time.
 
After this phone conversation, if you feel this facility may be worth looking at and may meet the needs of your loved one, then go ahead and make the appointment.  When you go, make sure you have the following information with you:

* Name of first and secondary insurance companies;

* Was he or she a Veteran or a spouse of a veteran?

* As much information on his or her medical condition as you can provide;

* A budget for him or her that you have figured out in advance, composed of Social Security income, amount of pension he or she is receiving, any other monthly income, savings, assets, or his or her ability to receive any other income from any other source.

From what you have just read, it makes it even clearer why you don’t want to be a “showupper.”  All of the above things have to be discussed in detail with each family.

Making an appointment is “where it’s at!”  Next up: Chapter 4 - General Aspects of Community

One is that it will definitely be less expensive, and the other is that he or she will have someone to talk to.  If you decide that sharing a room is a possibility, talk to the possible roommate of your loved one.  See if you think it would be a good match.

Make sure the room has all the safety features that are needed.  See if the air-conditioning comes on when you lower the thermostat.

When you are touring, if you think this facility may be in the running, then, ask to speak with the Food Service Director.  If you’re not in a big hurry, see if you can sample a meal.  If your family member is not with you, see if you can bring him or her back for a meal.

    static let chapter15Text = """
    When it comes to Assisted Living placement, gay seniors face more issues than seniors from the heterosexual community. First and foremost, members of the LGBTQ community are less likely to have adult children to care for them.

    Many LGBTQ community members have been forgotten or deserted by their own family members. This means there will be no relative or family member willing to oversee their care in their time of need.

    It is important to realize, that in the gay community, senior-related issues are still relatively new, as gay rights efforts have traditionally been youth focused.

    It should not matter if you are gay or straight, all individuals should have the same right to live in a place where people feel welcome and happy, respecting each other as part of a society.

    As we mentioned in other chapters, the selection of a facility should not be based on how fancy it is or how the person looks who is giving you a tour. It is about the WHOLE package, i.e.; employees, surroundings, clinical, services, activities, and in this case, the population and the supportive services available to the LGBTQ community.

    It is important to understand that, along with having lovely accommodations and great amenities, recreational activities are important as well. Recreational activities can vary from arts and crafts classes, to outings such as shows, movies, theater, dinner, shopping etc… and why not be able to go to a bar within reasonable hours… maybe for Happy Hour at 5 or 6 pm?

    For example, here is a question you may want to keep in mind. If you or your loved one is accustomed to having a drink every day at 6 pm, can you still have it in the new community you have chosen?

    The intention of this chapter is for you to be able to think about what is relevant to you and your loved one. It is not to create arguments or cause problems. You or your Caregiver must keep in mind that the selection of Alternative Housing, (Independent Living, Assisted Living, etc.) must meet some basic clinical, geographical, financial and psychosocial needs.

    In this chapter, we are giving you and/or your Caregiver basic information to help you in the process of selecting Alternative Housing, taking into consideration your specific likes and dislikes.

    Remember, in any community or society, there is always some form of discrimination among themselves. Society tends to label people and their behaviors rather than embrace and try to understand the differences.

    Finding out if a corporation offers same sex or partnership benefits to their employees is a good indication of what that corporation is about and if they are sensitive to diverse needs.

    You may find out that the person who is conducting the interview at the facility may be gay or gay friendly, but that does not mean that the facility or the corporation is.

    It is important to find out if the community you are interested in is involved with any gay organizations and how in tune they are to LGBTQ needs. If not, which may be the most common case, ask if they know of any gay organizations close to the facility so that you may be able to take advantage of their activities.

    Regarding accommodations, it is important that you know it is very normal for 2 men or 2 women to be accommodated in the same room as roommates. Many older adults cannot afford to have a private room and opt for sharing with another person. In fact, sharing a room is more the norm that having a private accommodation.

    Assisted Living Communities offer special spousal fees, rates and services. We have set up a question format so that you will be able to take advantage of these benefits if it applies in your state, based on your legal status. Some of the benefits are second person fees, couple fees, security deposits, etc.

    As we mentioned in previous chapters, there is a second person special rate. It is important to understand how this second person rate can work for you, if it is applicable.

    Depending on what state you are in, and their laws, you may or may not be able to take advantage of this specific rate for couples. The second person rate usually applies to a legally married spouse.

    It is also the norm to leave the community for a specific event. Many residents go to family functions, travel to visit relatives or just go out to dinner with a friend. While this is normal, it is important to respect the rules in your new community.

    Remember that these communities are regulated by a governmental agency and the community itself must follow rules and regulations. Most have a sign out sheet. This record is important for your safety. Imagine if there were a fire and they could not find you? Or if your family called and the facility had no idea where you were? You can see that this could cause serious issues.

    When you have a question concerning the rules and regulations, please ask the Administrator and you will most likely find out that the answer has something to do with state regulations.

    Along with state regulations, there are or could be policies and procedures that are specific to each individual corporation. These policies and procedures are legal and they must be followed. Corporations can have their own policies and procedures as long as they do not interfere with the state regulations for Alternative Housing.

    It is important to be realistic with the situation that you are facing while searching for that special place. Things may not be as perfect as we may want them to be, so it is important to be creative and make it as perfect as possible for you.

    One of the amenities that may be very important is the transportation service. This feature of a community may be relevant for some individuals. If you are the type of person who likes to go out or see friends on a regular basis, you may want to make sure that the community offers transportation. You may want to ask if it is a bus or a private car, if that is relevant to you.

    While you are receiving a tour of the community, make sure that you ask the person that is touring you if they feel that a gay resident would be comfortable in their facility.

    As people who have worked in the industry for many years, we understand the industry very well and no matter if it is in Florida or California, remember, Healthcare is a business. Independent Living, Assisted Living, Nursing Homes, etc…. are all a part of Healthcare. So, make sure that you ask questions from previous chapters and include the ones that are pertinent to your search.

    It is important to take into consideration your personal needs, your likes and dislikes, and your choice of lifestyle while selecting the correct assisted living facility for you.

    The following questions are specific and pertinent to the LGBTQ community.

    Humberto Fortuna, MA, MS, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1968. At age 20, Mr. Fortuna earned his first Master of Arts degree at the Santa Ana Music Conservatory. 
    Mr. Fortuna began his career in the health care field by working as an Activities Program Director in a senior center in South Florida. He became a Social Service Director in various long term care facilities and a Unit Manager for an Alzheimer’s-Dementia skilled nursing facility.
     Mr. Fortuna was awarded his second Master’s Degree in Health Care Management, with a concentration in Nursing Home Administration from Lynn University, Florida, in 1998. He then furthered his studies and received a Graduate Certificate in Aging Studies in 1999.  The same year, he became an Activity Consultant, certified by the National Certification Council for Activity Professionals.
     Mr. Fortuna was the Executive Director for a 220 bed Assisted Living Facility in Pompano Beach, Florida, until he went on to create his own company, Placement Counselors Corporation, in September, 1999. His company currently represents over 500 communities, including Skilled Nursing Facilities, Assisted Living Facilities, Adult Family Care Facilities, and Alzheimer’s-Dementia Units in the southeast region of Florida.  He also continues to be a consultant for the above mentioned facilities.
     Mr. Fortuna currently has his own private practice as a Geriatric Specialist and serves as a Board member for the SunServe organization, as well as other advisory boards.

    Cindy VanDusen began her senior advocate career as a Certified Exercise Instructor in 1983 and brought that knowledge to the senior population by creating exercise and fitness programs for many Assisted Living Facilities and Nursing Homes.  For 11 years, she owned and operated her own exercise studio, “Off Broadway Workshop,” where she offered special classes for seniors .
    In 1992, she created her own company, “Activities on Wheels” which brought activity programs into various health care facilities and senior living condominiums.  “Activities on Wheels” provided her with  experience in dealing with diverse types of health care facilities as well as a diverse senior population. She worked with Independent, Assisted Living, Dementia and Nursing Home residents, realizing that each segment of the senior population had very different needs.
     Cindy VanDusen has written and published many  books and games for the senior population including “Make Your Point,” (1996) “Math and Riddle Bingo,” (1998), “Quizmania,” (2001) and “You Can’t Bloom In Your Room,” (2003), all of which are still available today.
     After selling her successful company, she became interested in the Administration area of the health care industry.
