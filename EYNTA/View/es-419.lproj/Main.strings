/* Class = "UITextView"; text = "When it comes to Assisted Living placement, gay seniors face more issues than seniors from the heterosexual community. First and foremost, members of the LGBTQ community are less likely to have adult children to care for them. \n\nMany LGBTQ community members have been forgotten or deserted by their own family members. This means there will be no relative or family member willing to oversee their care in their time of need. \n\nMost states, counties or cities, do not have domestic partner laws in place. This ensures that gay couples will face more challenges concerning their overall benefits. \n\nIt is important to realize, that in the gay community, senior-related issues are still relatively new, as gay rights efforts have traditionally been youth focused. \n\nIt should not matter if you are gay or straight, all individuals should have the same right to live in a place where people feel welcome and happy, respecting each other as part of a society. \n\nAs we mentioned in other chapters, the selection of a facility should not be based on how fancy it is or how the person looks who is giving you a tour. It is about the WHOLE package, i.e.; employees, surroundings, clinical, services, activities, and in this case, the population and the supportive services available to the LGBTQ community. \n\nIt is important to understand that, along with having lovely accommodations and great amenities, recreational activities are important as well. Recreational activities can vary from arts and crafts classes, to outings such as shows, movies, theater, dinner, shopping etc… and why not be able to go to a bar within reasonable hours… maybe for Happy Hour at 5 or 6 pm? \n\nFor example, here is a question you may want to keep in mind. If you or your loved one is accustomed to having a drink every day at 6 pm, can you still have it in the new community you have chosen? \n\nThe intention of this chapter is for you to be able to think about what is relevant to you and your loved one. It is not to create arguments or cause problems. You or your Caregiver must keep in mind that the selection of Alternative Housing, (Independent Living, Assisted Living, etc.) must meet some basic clinical, geographical, financial and psychosocial needs. \n\nIn this chapter, we are giving you and/or your Caregiver basic information to help you in the process of selecting Alternative Housing, taking into consideration your specific likes and dislikes. \n\nRemember, in any community or society, there is always some form of discrimination among themselves. Society tends to label people and their behaviors rather than embrace and try to understand the differences. \n\nFinding out if a corporation offers same sex or partnership benefits to their employees is a good indication of what that corporation is about and if they are sensitive to diverse needs. \n\nYou may find out that the person who is conducting the interview at the facility may be gay or gay friendly, but that does not mean that the facility or the corporation is.\n\nIt is important to find out if the community you are interested in is involved with any gay organizations and how in tune they are to LGBTQ needs. If not, which may be the most common case, ask if they know of any gay organizations close to the facility so that you may be able to take advantage of their activities.\n\nRegarding accommodations, it is important that you know it is very normal for 2 men or 2 women to be accommodated in the same room as roommates. Many older adults cannot afford to have a private room and opt for sharing with another person. In fact, sharing a room is more the norm that having a private accommodation. \n\nAssisted Living Communities offer special spousal fees, rates and services to straight couples. We have set up a question format so that you will be able to take advantage of these benefits if it applies in your state, based on your legal status. Some of the benefits are second person fees, couple fees, security deposits, etc.\n\nAs we mentioned in previous chapters, there is a second person special rate. It is important to understand how this second person rate can work for you, if it is applicable. \n\nDepending on what state you are in, and their laws, you may or may not be able to take advantage of this specific rate for couples. The second person rate usually applies to a spouse of a heterosexual couple. \n\nIf your state approves same sex marriages then you can argue the point that you should be entitled to receive this benefit. For example, a husband and wife move into a facility together. The regular monthly rate in this scenario will be $2000 per person. Due to the fact that they are husband and wife, one will pay the $2000 and the other will pay the second person rate. The second person rate can be as little as half of the regular rate. This heterosexual couple will then pay $2000 for one, $1000 for the second person rate with a total of $3000 for the couple’s monthly rate. Therefore, if a gay couple cannot benefit from this second person rate scenario, they will have to pay $2000 each to live in the same accommodations. \n\nIt is also the norm to leave the community for a specific event. Many residents go to family functions, travel to visit relatives or just go out to dinner with a friend. While this is normal, it is important to respect the rules in your new community. \n\nRemember that these communities are regulated by a governmental agency and the community itself must follow rules and regulations. Most have a sign out sheet. This record is important for your safety. Imagine if there were a fire and they could not find you? Or if your family called and the facility had no idea where you were? You can see that this could cause serious issues.\n\nWhen you have a question concerning the rules and regulations, please ask the Administrator and you will most likely find out that the answer has something to do with state regulations. \n\nAlong with state regulations, there are or could be policies and procedures that are specific to each individual corporation. These policies and procedures are legal and they must be followed. Corporations can have their own policies and procedures as long as they do not interfere with the state regulations for Alternative Housing. \n\nIt is important to be realistic with the situation that you are facing while searching for that special place. Things may not be as perfect as we may want them to be, so it is important to be creative and make it as perfect as possible for you.\n\nOne of the amenities that may be very important is the transportation service. This feature of a community may be relevant for some individuals. If you are the type of person who likes to go out or see friends on a regular basis, you may want to make sure that the community offers transportation. You may want to ask if it is a bus or a private car, if that is relevant to you. \n\nWhile you are receiving a tour of the community, make sure that you ask the person that is touring you if they feel that a gay resident would be comfortable in their facility. \n\nAs people who have worked in the industry for many years, we understand the industry very well and no matter if it is in Florida or California, remember, Healthcare is a business. Independent Living, Assisted Living, Nursing Homes, etc…. are all a part of Healthcare. So, make sure that you ask questions from previous chapters and include the ones that are pertinent to your search.\n\nIt is important to take into consideration your personal needs, your likes and dislikes, and your choice of lifestyle while selecting the correct assisted living facility for you. \n\nThe following questions are specific and pertinent to the LGBTQ community. \nIN OTHER WORDS \nSimple and to the POINT!!!... Every senior wants to be living in a place where specific needs and life experiences will be met and understood. We live in a straight society. Be realistic with your current situation, i.e.; financial, clinical, geographical and social. And make the absolute best out of your choice. This is important to ALL seniors, regardless of sexual orientation.  Next up: Chapter 16 - Acronyms & Vocabulary"; ObjectID = "Ade-ln-34a"; */
"Ade-ln-34a.text" = "Al momento de  requerir una internación en una Residencia Geriátrica los adultos homosexuales se enfrentan a más cuestiones que la comunidad heterosexual. Principalmente la realidad que hay menos probabilidades de que tengan hijos adultos que puedan cuidar de ellos./n/nMuchos miembros de esta comunidad fueron olvidados o abandonados por sus propios familiares. Esto significa que no va a tener un allegado o familiar que vele por su cuidado cuando lo necesite./n/nEs necesario darse cuenta que, en la comunidad homosexual, las cuestiones relacionadas a los adultos mayores  son relativamente nuevas, como también el esfuerzo realizado  en el sentido de sus derechos./n/nNo importa si Usted es homosexual o heterosexual, todos los individuos tienen los mismos derechos de vivir en un lugar donde las personas se sientan bienvenidas y feliz, respetándose uno de otro como parte de la sociedad./n/nComo mencionamos en otros capítulos, la elección de una Residencia no debería estar basada en cuán lujosa es o cómo se ve la persona que nos está acompañando a conocer la misma. Tiene que ver con todo el conjunto; por ejemplo: empleados, los alrededores, el aspecto clínico, los servicios, las actividades y en este caso, la población y los servicios de apoyo disponibles para la comunidad homosexual, LGBTQ./n/nEs importante entender que aparte de tener un  hermoso alojamiento y grandes servicios, la actividad recreacional también es importante. Las actividades recreacionales pueden variar desde actividades artísticas, como salidas a shows, al cine, teatro, a cenar, a hacer compras, etc…y ¿por  qué no ir a un Bar? , por supuesto en horas razonables… ¿Qué tal durante “happy hour” a las 5 pm o 6 pm?/n/nPor ejemplo, aquí hay una pregunta que usted querrá mantener en su mente. Si Usted o  su ser querido está acostumbrado a tomar un trago todos los días a las 6 pm, ¿podrá  hacerlo en la Residencia donde se encuentra?/n/nLa intención de este capítulo es para que pueda pensar en qué es lo relevante para Usted y su ser querido. No es para crear discordia o causar problemas. Usted o su Cuidador deben de  tener en mente que para la  selección de la Residencia deben de  tener en cuenta las necesidades básicas clínicas, geográficas, financieras y psicosociales./n/nEn este capítulo estamos brindando información básica para ayudar en el proceso de selección de la Residencia Geriátrica adecuada, considerando sus gustos particulares./n/nRecuerde, en cualquier tipo de sociedad existe algún tipo de discriminación. La sociedad tiende a etiquetar a las personas y sus comportamientos más que comprender y aceptar las diferencias./n/nSaber si una Corporación  ofrece los mismos beneficios a sus empleados sin discriminar es un buen indicador acerca de qué tipo de Corporación es y si atiende sus diversas necesidades./n/nUsted puede encontrar que la persona que realiza la entrevista en la Residencia puede ser gay o muestra no discriminación hacia la homosexualidad, pero eso no significa que la Corporación o la Residencia se conduzcan de la misma manera./n/nEs importante conocer si la Residencia que Usted está interesado se encuentra involucrada con alguna Organización homosexual, y cuán a tono están con sus necesidades.  De no ser así, que es el caso más común, pregunte si conocen alguna Organización homosexual cercana así puede estar en contacto y participar de sus actividades./n/nRepetimos, es importante de entender que tener un Administrador o un Director de marketing que es gay o que no discrimina no significa  que la Residencia Geriátrica así lo haga./n/nCon respecto a las comodidades, es importante que usted sepa que es muy común que a dos hombres o dos mujeres sean ubicadas en la misma habitación como compañeros de cuarto. Muchos adultos mayores no pueden afrontar el costo de una habitación privada por lo cual optan por compartir la habitación, lo que es  más común, de hecho./n/nLas Residencias Geriátricas ofrecen aranceles y servicios especiales para matrimonios heterosexuales. Hemos incluido un formulario de preguntas para que Usted pueda acceder a estos beneficios si se aplican en su Estado, basado en su status legal. Algunos beneficios tienen que ver con aranceles para parejas, depósitos, etc./n/nComo mencionamos en capítulos previos, existe un arancel especial para la segunda persona.  Es importante saber cómo funciona esto, de ser aplicable./n/nDepende en qué Estado se encuentra, y cuáles son sus leyes, usted podrá o no acceder a las ventajas de estos aranceles específicos para parejas. El arancel especial para la segunda persona generalmente se aplica para matrimonios./n/nSi están casados Usted puede peticionar acceder a ese beneficio. Por ejemplo: un matrimonio se muda a una Residencia Geriátrica. El arancel mensual es de U$S 2000 por persona. Teniendo en cuenta que es un matrimonio, una persona va a pagar U$S 2000 y la otra el arancel especial correspondiente a segunda persona. El matrimonio pagará U$S 2000 por una persona y U$S 1000 por la segunda, un total de U$S 3000. En este sentido si una pareja no puede acceder a este beneficio, tendrá que pagar U$S 2000 por cada uno para vivir en el mismo alojamiento./n/nEs muy común también realizar diferentes salidas de acuerdo a eventos específicos. Muchos Residentes viajan para ver a sus familiares o salen a comer con amistades.  Aunque esto es común, es importante respetar las reglas de la comunidad./n/nRecuerde que estas Residencias están reguladas por el Agencias del Gobierno por lo cual se deben seguir reglas y reglamentaciones. Casi todas tienen un registro de salidas. Este registro es importante para su seguridad. Imagínese si hay un incendio y no lo pueden encontrar. O si su familia llama y en la Residencia nadie tiene idea de dónde está.  Usted ve que puede traer serios inconvenientes./n/nCuando tenga dudas sobre las reglas o regulaciones por favor, pregunte al Administrador y usted encontrará que la respuesta tiene algo que ver con las reglamentaciones estatales./n/nDe acuerdo a las Regulaciones estatales, existen políticas y procedimientos que son específicas para cada Corporación. Estas regulaciones son legales y hay que seguirlas. Las Corporaciones pueden tener sus propias reglamentaciones siempre y cuando no interfieran con las estatales./n/nEs importante ser realista al momento de buscar ese lugar especial. Las cosas pueden no ser tan perfectas como nosotros esperaríamos, por lo cual hay que ser creativo y hacerlas lo más perfectas posibles para usted./n/nUno de los servicios a considerar es la transportación. Esto suele ser relevante para muchas personas. Si usted es de aquellas personas que le gusta visitar a su familia regularmente, debe asegurarse que la residencia lo ofrezca./n/nCuando usted está visitando una Residencia Geriátrica, asegúrese de preguntar si una persona homosexual se sentiría confortable en ese lugar./n/nComo personas que hemos trabajado en este campo de la salud  por varios años,  nosotros entendemos muy bien la industria de la salud;  y  no importa en qué lugar sea, lo mismo en Florida que en California, siempre recuerden, que el cuidado de la salud es un negocio.  Residencias Independientes,  Asistidas, Sanatorios, etc… son todas partes de la industria del cuidado de la salud. Entonces, asegúrese  que usted  incluya  preguntas de  capítulos anteriores  que sean  pertinentes para usted./n/nTiene que considerar sus necesidades personales, sus preferencias, sus gustos, y su elección de estilo de vida al elegir la residencia correcta para usted./n/nLas preguntas siguientes son específicas y pertinentes a la Comunidad homosexual. y. \nEN OTRAS PALABRAS \nSimple y directo al PUNTO... Todos los Adultos mayores quieren vivir en un lugar donde sus necesidades específicas y experiencias de vida sean aceptadas y entendidas. Sea realista con su situación actual, por ejemplo: financiera, clínica, geográfica y social. Haga la mejor elección para usted.

Many of you are looking for a community that is beautiful and fancy.  While you want it to be nice, you have to realize the true needs of the person who will be living there. You know your loved one better than anyone else. Would a chandelier and marble floor be important to them? If it is, then you may have to take that into consideration. Otherwise, those items could make your loved one feel uncomfortable if he or she is not used to it.\f\nAlso, while looking for communities to visit, remember that the largest and most expensive advertisement doesn’t always represent the most loving and caring place.  When looking for communities, you can ask friends, go on the internet, talk to your clergy, look in the phone book, call a placement agency, or a social service agency. \n\nMake sure you look at communities that match the geographical needs of you and your loved one.  You want it to be close to family and possibly, their doctor. \n\nIt’s important to make a plan.  After you choose the communities that you’re going to go and see, set up a tour.  Dedicate a day to do this.  Allow at least an hour for each community.  You may want to see one in the morning, have lunch and see two in the afternoon.  However you want to do it, just make sure that you allow enough time to tour each community and time to get from one to the other.  If it takes more than one day, that is fine also.  The key is to stay calm and gather all of the information you are going to need to make a decision that both you and your loved one will be comfortable with.\n\nMany people like to just “show up” at a community without an appointment.  These people are called “show-uppers.”  There are many reasons why this is not a good idea. The most important one is time.  If you show up for a tour without an appointment, there may be another family touring and you may have to wait a long time until they can get to you.  Good communities take time with each family. You would want this same treatment for you and your family as well.  So, don’t be a “SHOW-UPPER!”\n\nHaving been Administrators of very large communities, we have witnessed, first hand, what can happen when people just  “show up.” You may come upon a scenario that is unpleasant or unnerving.  Things happen in communities with an elderly population, and the community should not be judged by an isolated incident, but by how it is handled by the staff. \n\nAnother important reason you should make an appointment is the fact that you want to tour the community with the Sales or Marketing Representative, not a receptionist or office worker as a fill in. While they may be able to show you around, they are not going to be able to answer all of your questions and give you the personal attention that you will require in making this important decision. In other words, you may end up getting a tour from the janitor on his way to Mrs. Jones in room 209.\n\nRemember, all of these communities are regulated by state laws, but don’t expect perfection at all times.  These same communities are run by human beings, and we know human beings are not perfect.\n\nOnce you are in the community and touring, look around and try to think…would your loved one like it?  Is it a place where they would be comfortable?  Is it what they are used to?  Look at the activities that are offered.  Will they be of interest to them?  When you look at the rooms, try to think of what they will require.  Maybe, it’s just a television, an easy chair, a bed, a dresser, a refrigerator, a closet and a bathroom.  The important thing is that you must try to judge everything based on what THEY will require, not what YOU require.

/* Class = "UITextView"; text = "In the past two decades, Assisted Living Facilities have grown nationwide in the health care industry.\n\nThere are approximately 40,000 Assisted Living Facilities operating in the United States today.  The number of residents living in a facility can range from just a few to over 300, with the most common size housing between 25 and 120 individuals.\n\nYears ago, everyone referred to all nursing facilities as “the home.”  The population within them was a mix and match of all ages, diagnoses, and behaviors.  When a family could no longer care for a loved one, they had no choice but to place him or her in “the home.”  It was the only option available to them at the time.\n\nWhen Assisted Living Facilities were first created, they were more like hotels or retirement communities.  If people had incontinence issues or required more one on one supervised, personal care, they would have to leave the facility and go to a nursing home.\n\nDuring this time there was a tremendous growth in the senior population.  This was due to many factors such as seniors living longer, and the knowledge that the baby boomers would be aging in the very near future.  The governmental agencies, nationwide, had to modify, update, and find new ways to accommodate the senior community.\n\nThe government and the health care industry worked together to create regulated communities to provide appropriate, as well as personalized care that would meet the needs of each individual.  These changes not only improved the quality of service, but made it more cost-effective for families paying privately.  It was also more cost-effective for the government to assist an individual financially and make sure they were receiving the proper care in an Assisted Living Facility rather than a Skilled Nursing Home.\n\nOnce the Assisted Living Facilities were established, the need for other types of alternative housing came to light.  Some of these were Independent Living Facilities, Adult Family Care Homes, Alzheimer-Dementia Units and Skilled Nursing Facilities.\n\nEven today, many people do not completely understand the concept of, or what is actually offered in an Assisted Living Facility.\n\nAssisted Living Facilities are licensed and regulated by the state in which they are located.  Because the concept of an Assisted Living Facility can vary from state to state, eligibility can also vary.\n\nIn some cases, the criterion for being admitted into an Assisted Living Facility, is as simple as being able to transfer from one chair to another with assistance.  Keep in mind, the resident must be able to assist in completing this task.  The purpose of an Assisted Living Facility is to “ASSIST,” not to actually do the task for the resident.  The goal is to keep the resident as active and involved in his own personal care while performing the Activities of Daily Living.\n\nAdmission criteria are not only based on clinical aspects, but on many other issues such as safety.  A prospective resident must be physically able to exit the building, with assistance, in a fire drill or any other emergency situation.    \n\nIn some cases, Assisted Living Facilities will not admit people even if they can transfer.   Each facility has its own criteria, their own policies, and their own target population type.  They may not want wheelchairs or even walkers. This is up to them.  They can implement any house policy they choose, as long as they remain in compliance with the state regulations. \n\nBecause Assisted Living Facilities are privately or corporately owned, the policies they implement are legal as long as they are approved by the health care administration in whatever state they are located.\n\nAssisted Living Facility is the most common term used for this type of housing.  Some other terms are:\n\n     • Residential Care Facilities\n     • Personal Care Facilities\n     • Adult Congregate Care Communities\n     • Retirement Residences\n     • Supported Care Facilities\n     • Senior Living Communities \nIn Florida, and in many other states, six-bed facilities are becoming very popular, as well.  These smaller facilities are gaining popularity due to the fact that they are able to provide more personalized services.  These facilities are usually in private homes and are licensed and regulated by the same governmental agencies that govern all of the Assisted Living Facilities, regardless of size.  The smaller homes must pass all surveys and inspections required by the state in which they are located. \n The average age of a resident in an Assisted Living Facility is a little over 80, and usually someone who is in need of at least one or more Activities of Daily Living.  Some of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) are showering, dressing, toileting, eating and medication management.  The staff of an Assisted Living Facility is trained to provide assistance with all of those ADLs. \n\nWe should mention here that the need for some type of lifestyle change is usually first indicated when a person has difficulty in one or more of the following areas:\n\n     • Difficulty in self-care, such as bathing, dressing, toileting, or eating;\n     • Decline in physical or mental health;\n     • Family not available to provide care or supervision. \nAs we mentioned before, as a result of new regulations and changes in the health care industry, residents are now provided with more services in an Assisted Living Facility to include, but are not limited to:  housekeeping and laundry services, transportation to doctors, social activities and 24 hour supervision.\n\nThere are many Assisted Living Facilities that provide care for the mentally ill and people with advanced dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Secured areas for individuals that require closer supervision in order to manage their behaviors are provided.  These areas can be a part of the main building or a separate, self-contained unit. \n\nAssisted Living Facilities offer social and recreational programs, entertainment, and other stimulating activities.  Studies show that social interaction and activities have a strong impact on the well- being of the elderly.  The goal of the Assisted Living Facility is to promote the independence of the residents as well as provide a home-like setting.  Having an active and social environment can help to achieve this goal. \n\nMost facilities are paid for by private, “out of pocket” funds.  However, financial assistance can be found through the Veteran’s Administration, Long Term Care Insurance, and some state programs if certain requirements are met.\n\nThe majority of facilities receive payments on a monthly basis, similar to a rent. Many require a security deposit or a community fee which may be refundable, depending on the community policy.\n\nIt is important to note that additional fees may be included in the monthly rate.  There may be fees for “a la carte” services or Level of Care.  Some communities do have an all-inclusive rate which may be more beneficial for the prospective resident.  This will allow for more care as needed while maintaining the same monthly rate. \n\nEvery state requires a contract.  In this contract, you will find the monthly costs and a list of services that the individual will be receiving at the facility. Contracts may be broken by giving a written notice in the time frame required by the state in which the facility is located and by the community policy.\n\nOverall, the best way to describe Assisted Living is to think of it as a bridge between living at home and living in a nursing home.  Assisted Living has a residential focus with a home-like environment.  A nursing home is primarily a medical institution.\n\nAssisted Living is an exciting option for individuals who want to maximize their independence while living in the safety of a supervised, residential setting.  Next up: Chapter 2 - In Other Words\n"; ObjectID = "NQU-4t-fWH"; */
